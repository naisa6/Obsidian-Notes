## Constructing a web cache deception attack

Generally speaking, constructing a basic web cache deception attack involves the following steps:

1. Identify a target endpoint that returns a dynamic response containing sensitive information. Review responses in Burp, as some sensitive information may not be visible on the rendered page. Focus on endpoints that support the `GET`, `HEAD`, or `OPTIONS` methods as requests that alter the origin server's state are generally not cached.
2. Identify a discrepancy in how the cache and origin server parse the URL path. This could be a discrepancy in how they:
    
    - Map URLs to resources.
    - Process delimiter characters.
    - Normalize paths.
3. Craft a malicious URL that uses the discrepancy to trick the cache into storing a dynamic response. When the victim accesses the URL, their response is stored in the cache. Using Burp, you can then send a request to the same URL to fetch the cached response containing the victim's data. Avoid doing this directly in the browser as some applications redirect users without a session or invalidate local data, which could hide a vulnerability.

We'll explore some different approaches for constructing a web cache deception attack.

### Using a cache buster

While testing for discrepancies and crafting a web cache deception exploit, make sure that each request you send has a different cache key. Otherwise, you may be served cached responses, which will impact your test results.

As both URL path and any query parameters are typically included in the cache key, you can change the key by adding a query string to the path and changing it each time you send a request. Automate this process using the Param Miner extension. To do this, once you've installed the extension, click on the top-level **Param miner > Settings** menu, then select **Add dynamic cachebuster**. Burp now adds a unique query string to every request that you make. You can view the added query strings in the **Logger** tab.

### Detecting cached responses

During testing, it's crucial that you're able to identify cached responses. To do so, look at response headers and response times.

Various response headers may indicate that it is cached. For example:

- The `X-Cache` header provides information about whether a response was served from the cache. Typical values include:
    - `X-Cache: hit` - The response was served from the cache.
    - `X-Cache: miss` - The cache did not contain a response for the request's key, so it was fetched from the origin server. In most cases, the response is then cached. To confirm this, send the request again to see whether the value updates to hit.
    - `X-Cache: dynamic` - The origin server dynamically generated the content. Generally this means the response is not suitable for caching.
    - `X-Cache: refresh` - The cached content was outdated and needed to be refreshed or revalidated.
- The `Cache-Control` header may include a directive that indicates caching, like `public` with a `max-age` higher than `0`. Note that this only suggests that the resource is cacheable. It isn't always indicative of caching, as the cache may sometimes override this header.

If you notice a big difference in response time for the same request, this may also indicate that the faster response is served from the cache.

### Detecting normalization by the origin server

To test how the origin server normalizes the URL path, send a request to a non-cacheable resource with a path traversal sequence and an arbitrary directory at the start of the path. To choose a non-cacheable resource, look for a non-idempotent method like `POST`. For example, modify `/profile` to `/aaa/..%2fprofile`:

- If the response matches the base response and returns the profile information, this indicates that the path has been interpreted as `/profile`. The origin server decodes the slash and resolves the dot-segment.
- If the response doesn't match the base response, for example returning a `404` error message, this indicates that the path has been interpreted as `/aaa/..%2fprofile`. The origin server either doesn't decode the slash or resolve the dot-segment.

#### Note

When testing for normalization, start by encoding only the second slash in the dot-segment. This is important because some CDNs match the slash following the static directory prefix.

You can also try encoding the full path traversal sequence, or encoding a dot instead of the slash. This can sometimes impact whether the parser decodes the sequence.

### Detecting normalization by the cache server

You can use a few different methods to test how the cache normalizes the path. Start by identifying potential static directories. In **Proxy > HTTP history**, look for requests with common static directory prefixes and cached responses. Focus on static resources by setting the HTTP history filter to only show messages with 2xx responses and script, images, and CSS MIME types.

You can then choose a request with a cached response and resend the request with a path traversal sequence and an arbitrary directory at the start of the static path. Choose a request with a response that contains evidence of being cached. For example, `/aaa/..%2fassets/js/stockCheck.js`:

- If the response is no longer cached, this indicates that the cache isn't normalizing the path before mapping it to the endpoint. It shows that there is a cache rule based on the `/assets` prefix.
- If the response is still cached, this may indicate that the cache has normalized the path to `/assets/js/stockCheck.js`.

You can also add a path traversal sequence after the directory prefix. For example, modify `/assets/js/stockCheck.js` to `/assets/..%2fjs/stockCheck.js`:

- If the response is no longer cached, this indicates that the cache decodes the slash and resolves the dot-segment during normalization, interpreting the path as `/js/stockCheck.js`. It shows that there is a cache rule based on the `/assets` prefix.
- If the response is still cached, this may indicate that the cache hasn't decoded the slash or resolved the dot-segment, interpreting the path as `/assets/..%2fjs/stockCheck.js`.

Note that in both cases, the response may be cached due to another cache rule, such as one based on the file extension. To confirm that the cache rule is based on the static directory, replace the path after the directory prefix with an arbitrary string. For example, `/assets/aaa`. If the response is still cached, this confirms the cache rule is based on the `/assets` prefix. Note that if the response doesn't appear to be cached, this doesn't necessarily rule out a static directory cache rule as sometimes `404` responses aren't cached.

#### Note

It's possible that you may not be able to definitively determine whether the cache decodes dot-segments and decodes the URL path without attempting an exploit.
